Starter code usage:
- Yes. This code uses the starter code as a base.

How to run (batch mode):
1. cd src
2. make clean
3. make mysh
4. cd ../test-cases
5. ../src/mysh < T_FCFS.txt

Note: To avoid ambiguity, TA-style execution from `test-cases/` is `make -C ../src clean mysh` then `../src/mysh < T_*.txt`.
